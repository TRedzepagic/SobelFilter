# Sobel Edge Detector

A Sobel Edge Detection Filter written in OpenCL and C++. The library makes use of FreeImage to load and save image files.

## Example

Here's what the library does:

## Usage

The RunSobel.cpp gives an example of how to use the library. It is outlined here:

    #include "SobelFilter.h"
	...

	std::string Path = "myimage.bmp";

	// Declare the edge detector
	SobelFilter EdgeDetector;

	// Load the image from the file
	EdgeDetector.LoadImage(Path.c_str());

	// Run it
	EdgeDetector.Run();

	// Save the edge detected image
	// Use .bmp to make working with FreeImage easy
	std::string OutputPath = "sobel_" + Path + ".bmp";
	EdgeDetector.SaveImage(OutputPath.c_str());

And that's it. You'll get a file called `sobel_myimage.bmp.bmp` as output.

I've included a common folder in the repo. It includes the OpenCL and FreeImage libraries needed to run
the filter. 

There is also commented out code for the OpenCL 2.0 versions of the commands that are now deprecated.

## Command Line Usage
See the `run.sh` file on how to compile and run the code

    g++ -c SobelFilter.cpp -lOpenCL -Icommon/OpenCL/include -Icommon/FreeImage/include -std=c++11 -o SobelFilter.a
    g++ RunSobel.cpp SobelFilter.a common/FreeImage/lib/linux/x86_64/libfreeimage.a -lOpenCL -Icommon/OpenCL/include -std=c++11 -o sobel

    ./sobel lena.bmp

This first compiles the SobelFilter library, then it compiles the RubSobel command line program. Once it is compiled just call `sobel` and the path to
the file you want to run it against.
